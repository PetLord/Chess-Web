          <p class="news-item-text">It's just the second month of 2023, but we may have the game of the year on our hands. The following game was played by 39-year-old GM Gergely-Andras-Gyula Szabo at the Romanian Chess Championship 2023.

            Szabo's round-six victory over FM Nicodim-Cosmin Stepanencu is stunning enough to deserve a standalone article. It features a queen sacrifice, a mesmerizing tactical melee in which White sacrifices the kitchen sink, and a beautiful forced checkmate sequence to finish the game.
            
            Starting with 27.Nh6!+, as played in the game, White had a forced checkmate in 16 moves!"
